# Project {for,in} R{uby}

Common Lisp hackers will know what I mean when I say "it's Defsystem in 
Ruby".  They will then shortly be disappointed when they realise just
how little it actually does (almost nothing whatsoever) compared to the
system definition tools they know and are used to.  Just warning you,
guys.

Everyone else will have to wait for the documentation (coming 
soon).  Or Google for it
